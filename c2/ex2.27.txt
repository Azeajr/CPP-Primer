Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.
a) int i = -1, &r = 0;
Not legal, initializer must be an object
b) int *const p2 = &i2;
Legal
c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;
Legal since 0 is const
d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
Legal.
e) const int *p1 = &i2;
Legal.
f) const int &const r2;
'const' qualifier may not be applied to a reference and reference needs to be initialized
g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;
Legal
