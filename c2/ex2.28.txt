Explain the following definitions.  Identify any that are illegal.
a) int i, *const cp;
i is an integer variable and cp is pointer to a constant integer.
Not legal, cp needs to be initialized.
b) int *p1, *const p2;
p1 is pointer to an integer variable while p2 is pointer to a constant integer.
Not legal, p2 needs to be initialized.
c) const int ic, &r = ic;
const integer variable ic and a constant reference to that constant.
Not legal, ic is not initialized.
d) const int *const p3;
p3 is constant pointer which can point at integer constants.
Needs to be initialized, but other than that this is legal.
e) const *p1, *const p2;
Illegal, no type is specified.
